# King County Housing Project
Evaluation of King County's housing data.
This project evaluated data about home sales in the Seattle, Washington (King county) area to understand what factors about a home impact its price. The output was a model that will **predict the prices of homes** sold. The general process followed included two parts:
- Part one focused on exploring the data and use different statistical tests and linear regression to understand the relationships present between the price and different features
- Part two was aimed at building a model that predicts home prices as accurately as possible.
